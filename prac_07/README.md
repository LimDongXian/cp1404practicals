### Lessons Learned about Clean Code
- **Write Code for Readability**: Ensuring my code is easy for others (and future me) to read has been a priority.
- **Consistent Formatting and Style**: Iâ€™ve learned that following a consistent style, helps keep code visually organized and minimizes confusion when working in teams.
