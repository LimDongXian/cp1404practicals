# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates for practical tasks were generally within the right range, but often on the optimistic side.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, I became more accurate with my estimates as I gained a better understanding of the time required for
different tasks.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that estimating accurately is a skill that improves with experience. I also realized the importance of
factoring in time for unexpected challenges and testing, rather than just focusing on the coding part.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed by others taught me the value of constructive feedback. I learned to view my code from different
perspectives and improved my ability to identify areas for optimization, better structure, and clearer documentation.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code made me more aware of common mistakes and areas that often need improvement, such as code
readability, commenting, and handling edge cases.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/linpyaehtet/cp1404practicals/pull/6]()

### Explanation

Is good to use the shortcut key (Ctrl+Alt+L) during and at the end of the code to auto reformat the file making it more
readable.

### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/YY-05/cp1404/pull/2#issuecomment-2446002833]()

### Explanation

Commit message should be start with title case and explain what you has done, not just commit every single function
added without any explanation.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge, I would include more real-world scenarios and open-ended challenges in the practical tasks.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
